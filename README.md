## Description
This Unity 3D project demonstrates the implementation of basic vehicle control systems, featuring a drivable car and a controllable airplane. It covers core movement mechanics such as acceleration and steering. The project was developed as part of a course to practice player input handling, vehicle physics, and core gameplay foundations in Unity.

## Features
- Drivable car with basic movement mechanics (acceleration and steering).
- Controllable airplane with fundamental flight controls.
- Player input handling using Unity’s input system.
- Basic vehicle physics and movement behavior.
- Camera control adapted to each vehicle.
- Simple scene setup for testing vehicle controls.
- Project developed as part of a learning course focused on Unity gameplay fundamentals.

## Technical requirements:
- **Unity Version:** 2021.3.9f1 or higher.
- **Render Pipeline:** URP.
- **Platforms:** PC.
